  The original R package comes from  Xu Jingï¼Œhttps://github.com/DataXujing/gcForest_r.git

## 1.Introduction

Because I recently participated in a competition, I used the R package of gcForest. For the existing gcForest package, I found that I only need to use the part of cascade_forest, so I made some changes to it and solemnly stated that this R package is only Used for better participation in the competition.

Many thanks to https://github.com/DataXujing/gcForest_r.git
The author, my revision is based entirely on this project, and the modifications are only to meet the needs of participating in the competition. Thanks again

The gcForest algorithm was suggested in Zhou and Feng 2017 (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835> , refer for this paper for technical details) and pylablanche(<https://github.com/pylablanche>) who provide a Python3.X implementation of this algorithm on github (<https://github.com/pylablanche/gcForest>). We provide a R package called gcForest which is the R interface of the  pylablanche's gcForest module (Python3.X). And if you want to known more about gcForest, please read the source paper (Deep Forest).
